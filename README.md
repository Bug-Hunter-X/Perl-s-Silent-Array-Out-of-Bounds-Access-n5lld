This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in Perl: the silent handling of out-of-bounds array accesses.  Accessing an array element beyond its defined index does not result in an error; instead, it returns undef. This can lead to unexpected results and make debugging more difficult. The `bug.pl` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.pl` offers a solution using proper bounds checking.
